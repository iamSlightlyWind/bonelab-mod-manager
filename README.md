  The ETA is a bit underconfident since it doesn't account for download speeds improving as other mods finish downloading.
  Also, my computer's download speed is normally around 1 MB/s lol

## Features

- Multi-platform
  - macOS
  - Linux
  - Windows
- Parallel downloads
- Installs subscribed mod.io mods
- Updates mods
- Removes unsubscribed mods

## Roadmap

- Install mods directly in PC Bonelab installation

## How to Use

1. Download the appropriate file from the [latest release](https://github.com/valentinegb/bonelab_mod_manager/releases/latest) for your OS.
2. Launch the program, by double clicking or other method.
  - If you're on Windows, you may be prevented from launching the program by a popup warning you that the program is not safe.
    It is, and if you don't believe me you can check the code yourself. To launch the program anyway, click "More info" then "Run anyway".
3. On your first time running, you will be prompted to sign in to mod.io. Use the arrow keys to select your method of signing in then press enter.
4. After signing in, the program will do the rest for you! Sit back, relax, and watch as all your mods are downloaded and installed.
5. Next time you want to sync your installed mods, just run the program again.
