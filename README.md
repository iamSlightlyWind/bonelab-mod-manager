  The ETA is a bit underconfident since it doesn't account for download speeds improving as other mods finish downloading.
  Also, my computer's download speed is normally around 1 MB/s lol

## How to Use

1. Download the appropriate file from the [latest release](https://github.com/valentinegb/bonelab_mod_manager/releases/latest) (or [a pre-release](https://github.com/valentinegb/bonelab_mod_manager/releases)) for your OS.
2. Launch the program, by double clicking or other method.
  - If you're on Windows, you may be prevented from launching the program by a popup warning you that the program is not safe.
    It is, and if you don't believe me you can check the code yourself. To launch the program anyway, click "More info" then "Run anyway".
3. On your first time running, you will be prompted to sign in to mod.io. Use the arrow keys to select your method of signing in then press enter.
4. If you are on Windows, you will be prompted whether you would like to install PC mods or Quest mods.
5. After that, the program will do the rest for you! Sit back, relax, and watch as all your mods are downloaded and installed.
6. Next time you want to sync your installed mods, just run the program again.

## Quest Mod Installation Path

PC mods are installed directly into a PC Bonelab installation, but Quest mods must be manually put onto your headset. Quest mods are installed in a directory dependent on your OS.

macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/com.valentinegb.bonelab_mod_manager/Mods`

Linux: `~/var/lib/bonelab_mod_manager/Mods`

Windows: `%AppData%/bonelab_mod_manager/Mods`

I know, it isn't ideal having to move the mods from this folder to your headset,
but it's on the roadmap for the mod manager to do that for you, it will in the future!
